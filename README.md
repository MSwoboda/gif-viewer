# gif-viewer

This is a demo project based on Giphy API. Content of the page is created dynamically based on a constant array of topics and user defined topics. 
Each button press loads 10 gifs based on the button query. Each consecutive press adds an additional 10 gifs. Gif will load still and will animate on key press. Subsequent key press will again pause the animation. Buttons can be dynamically added using the Add Animal form. Dynamically created buttons will maintain all functionality described above.
